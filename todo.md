- [x] Validate consent, language toggling, accessible dialogs, and PDF generation before delivery.

## NLP Intake, i18n, and Workflow Redesign

- [x] Define the non-diagnostic NLP output schema, safety guardrails, route confidence policy, and 15-question route requirements.
- [x] Upgrade PxK to use server-side language-model calls and authenticated persistent data for saved progress.
- [x] Add a natural-language concern intake that maps user wording to a transparent screening route without diagnosing a condition.
- [x] Extend each screening route to a coherent 15-question workflow with medical-term tooltips and clear review states.
- [x] Implement draft save, resume, update, and discard flows for incomplete screening sessions.
- [x] Add i18n coverage across the full interface for English, Kannada, Tulu, and Konkani, with clear reviewed-source fallbacks where necessary.
- [x] Redesign typography, page backgrounds, navigation hierarchy, and care-route guidance so the workflow is easy to understand at a glance.
- [x] Validate language fallbacks, NLP boundaries, persistence, tooltips, desktop/mobile usability, and production build before delivery.

## Completion Checks for Intelligent Workflow

- [x] Add an explicit discard action for saved screening drafts and verify the account-scoped draft state updates.
- [x] Thread the selected locale through every PxK route and replace remaining key page-level hardcoded copy with language-aware strings or an explicit source-language boundary.
- [x] Exercise and document the signed-in save, resume, discard, NLP intake, and tooltip interactions before final delivery.

## Final Locale and Interaction Evidence

- [x] Thread the locale through the model, provider, how-it-works, and about routes and add a page-level English-source boundary where reviewed translation is not available.
- [x] Record the signed-in save, resume, discard, NLP intake, and tooltip verification evidence in the project documentation.

## Voice, Appointment, and Provider Workflow Upgrade

- [x] Add consent-aware audio recording and server-side speech-to-text transcription for the complaint input.
- [x] Add voice-assisted selection of supported screening options, with on-screen confirmation before advancing.
- [x] Extend the database with patient profile and user-owned appointment records while minimising stored health information.
- [x] Add profile capture, clinician selection, availability choices, appointment booking, and a clear confirmation state.
- [x] Expand the fictional clinician directory without fabricated ratings, reviews, or testimonials.
- [x] Add a protected provider-facing appointment panel with the consented patient profile, complaint summary, screening factors, and appointment status.
- [x] Replace the header with a responsive pill-navigation implementation adapted to the existing PxK route system.
- [x] Improve global typography, spacing, information density, and background treatment for a calmer, more legible workflow.
- [x] Validate speech capture, transcription, voice actions, booking, provider privacy, navigation, mobile layouts, and production build.

## Clinician Review Completion Checks

- [x] Store clinician-readable screening questions and selected answers in the appointment ledger rather than internal answer keys.
- [x] Carry the Route Engine’s factor trace and non-diagnostic route rationale into the provider appointment record.
- [x] Add provider-access control test coverage and document the full voice-to-booking-to-provider review verification path.

## Speech-to-Text Repair

- [x] Trace and repair the reported microphone capture, audio upload, or server transcription failure.
- [x] Add a clear, accessible voice-input fallback and error state that preserves typed intake.
- [x] Verify a real in-browser transcription with the user before final delivery.

## Appointment Confirmation Repair

- [x] Trace and repair the reported appointment booking failure from patient form submission through the protected server procedure and database record creation.
- [x] Replace the generic booking error with actionable, privacy-safe feedback where possible.
- [x] Verify a real appointment confirmation and provider-panel record with the user before final delivery.

## Provider Record Layout Correction

- [x] Redesign the provider appointment detail so the key patient and appointment summary stays visible while the long complaint ledger is scanned.
- [x] Contain the ledger with an accessible internal scroll area and responsive grouping rather than requiring disruptive dialog resizing.
- [x] Verify the record detail at desktop and mobile sizes before final delivery.

## Final Provider Detail Evidence

- [x] Reconfirm the documented voice-to-booking-to-provider review verification record is present in the project notes.
- [x] Capture and record a post-redesign mobile check of the provider appointment tabs and internal scroll area.

## Mobile Expanded Record Check

- [x] Open a provider appointment at the mobile breakpoint and confirm the Overview, Complaint list, and Route factors tabs plus internal scrolling remain usable.

## Asset Portability and Account Navigation

- [x] Package all PxK image assets into a downloadable deployment-safe asset bundle and add a source manifest for the project ZIP.
- [x] Center primary navigation tabs within the desktop header while retaining responsive mobile navigation.
- [x] Add visible sign-in and sign-out actions with clear authenticated state in the header.
- [x] Add a profile icon/menu that links an authenticated patient directly to their screening history.
- [x] Validate asset-pack download access, account actions, centered navigation, history link, and mobile behaviour before delivery.

## Header Interaction Evidence

## Final Header Evidence

- [x] Record the completed mobile navbar/account-control check and signed-in/sign-out/profile-to-history confirmation in the verification notes.

## Local Demo Access and Approval Gate

- [ ] Replace the external authentication redirect with a visible local demo sign-in/sign-out state.
- [ ] Prevent the demo sign-in state from being represented as a real authenticated or secure patient account.
- [ ] Add an explicit required checklist before text or voice complaint intake, covering prototype use, consented browser processing, and non-diagnostic limits.
- [ ] Verify the approval checklist blocks typed and spoken complaints until all acknowledgements are given.
